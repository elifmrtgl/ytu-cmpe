With this study, it is aimed to provide an automated method for detecting the categories of news and at the same time to implement a system that helps to understand the contents of the news. Through different vectorization methods, tf-idf has chosen and implemented and for the classification part, 6 different machine learning models are used which are Logistic Regression, kNN, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes. According to the results the most successfull model is kNN with a 0.90 F1 Score.
