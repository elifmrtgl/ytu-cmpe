This code takes a pgm-formatted-file as an input and the file includes the number of rows and columns, the maximum number of a color can get and colors. Colors are shown by numbers. The algorithm reads from input.pgm and compresses it using Run Length Encoding. The encoded data is written to 'test_encoded.txt'. When the compressed file is given as input, the algorithm then decompresses it checking if it is decompressable. (Checks if the sizes are matching with the compression, if the colors shown by numbers are lower or equal to the max number possible, or if the compression is made without any mistake etc.) After decompressing the image, it writes the image to another pgm formatted file called 'test_decoded.pgm'. Lastly, you can update the image on the compressed data. For example you can make every 5's 10, change a given coordinates' values without decompressing it. It also calculates the histogram.
