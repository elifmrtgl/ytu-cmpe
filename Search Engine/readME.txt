This code implements the suggestion system of a searching engine when we type something to search bar. It takes two strings and the most related/asked other strings connected to these two strings as inputs and uses graphs implemented with linked lists to hold that information. It then merges these two different graphs if there are any the same string is found in the most related/asked strings. After that the user can enter a string like we do when we use search engines, the algorithm then searches for that string in the merged graph and lists the first three most searched neighbor of it.
