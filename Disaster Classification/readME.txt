This project was my semi-term project. It aims to classify natural disasters from images. I have gathered a dataset consists of 5 different categories which are: Drought, Earthquake, Fire, Flood and Normal. I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification part. I also have an article explaining CNNs and my project. 
The code has a GUI which lets you choose an image from the dataset and see the model's prediction.
