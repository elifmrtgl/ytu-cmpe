This code implements a cache mechnanism which uses Last Recently Used method. The code reads information from a file and puts every row in the cache accordingly. If the cache is full, it uses LRU to make space for the incoming then add the new one there. Before adding to cache, it keeps the information in a Hash Table which keeps the row's unique number,  cache number if it is in the cache, and flag controlling if it is in the cache, deleted, or never been added before.
